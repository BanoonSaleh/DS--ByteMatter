# Introduction

Since the launch of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, a roadmap set to harness the powers that God has bestowed upon us - our strategic position, our investment strength and our position at the center for the Arab and Islamic worlds. The full interest of the Kingdom and our leadership was to harness our potential to achieve our ambitions.
The vision has been transformed into many strategic objectives. This aims to enable effective implementation through the Vision Realization Programs, one of which is Human Capability Development Program (HCDP). 

Saudi Vision 2030 Objectives In Education System
The Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 aims to increase the efficiency of the educational sector and bring it to the best possible level in the offered programs of education level. It relies on the latest and modern education strategies and raises the learners' to think and analyze. 
To achieve this objectives, His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince, launched the (HCDP), one of the vision realization programs.

### Human Capability Development Program (HCDP)

The Program aims to prepare citizens for the job market and to be able to compete globally. It will do this through developing basic and future skills, developing knowledge and values that enhance the 21st century and global citizenship skills.

The Vision was cascaded into strategic objectives to enable effective implementation through Vision Realization Programs.

### Business Problem 

In order to improve the educational system, and make it much effective, one goal was to make the number of teachers and classes proportional to the number of students in a class. The targeted  number of students is 22 students per class by 2025 

 
### Study Approach 
We started by collecting data about the current state. Then, the collected data was analyzed in order to identify the number of schools with students more than the targeted number. Machine learning models were utilized in order to measure the goal at the current state and the progress to the accomplishment of the final goal by 2025. Finally, a plan was developed for achieving the final goal. 



### Current Status Analysis:

Average Students per Class in 2020.

This graph compares the average number of students per class and the maximum number assigned. It shows that in Eastern Province, Najran, Makkah, and Tabuk, the average number of students per class is slightly higher than the maximum number, which needs to be reconsidered. The rest of provinces, however, have either the same or less than the maximum number of students assigned for each class.

### Number of Students by Educational Level per Province


This graph shows the top eight provinces with  highest number of students in each educational level. It is clearly that elementary level has the highest number of students among all levels for all provinces, where it represents almost about 50% of each province's students. In contrast, kindergarten students has the least number of students in each province. Furthermore, high and middle school students are almost the same in each province.

### Number of New Kindergarten’s Students per Year

This figure shows the number of kindergarten's students per year. The year of 2019 has the highest number of kindergartens students. In 2020, during the pandemic, the schools system was turned into online classes, there for, the number of students has decreased by about 20%. In 2021, by the end of the pandemic, the number of kindergarten's students has sharply decreased from 21.2k to 2.5k which is about 88%, and that is because of the resistance of parents to send their children to school while the threat of Corona Virus is still present.

# Modelling


### Selecting The Prediction Target
The first step is to select the column we want to predict, which is “Avg_Student_Per_Class”,
Which indicates the average number of students per class. 
### Choosing the "Features"
The columns that are inputted into our model (and later used to make predictions) are called "features." In our case, those would be the columns used to determine the average number of students per class. We used all columns except the target as features. 
We selected multiple features by providing a list of column names inside brackets. Each item in that list should be a string (with quotes).
### Building Our Model
We used the scikit-learn library to create our models. Scikit-learn is easily the most popular library for modeling the types of data typically stored in DataFrames.
The steps to building and using a model are:
•	Define: What type of model will it be
•	We used Linear Regression to deal with continuous values (mean of students per class) and classification to mandate discrete values, (1)  if the average number of students per class is less than 22 (0)  if the average number of students per class is more than 22
•	Fit: Capture patterns from provided data. This is the heart of modeling.
•	Predict: Just what it sounds like
•	Evaluate: Determine how accurate the model's predictions are.
### Regression Models:
First, we tried to train out the regression models, so the first step we needed to do is splitting up our data into an X array that contains the features to train on, and a y array with the target variable, in our case the “Avg_Student_Per_Class” column. For the categorical features, we had to transform them into numbers(dummy/indicator) by using pandas.get_dummies.
After splitting the data, the baseline average was calculated to help characterize past performance for selected monitored parameters, assess present performance, and estimate future performance.
We performed some models which are (KNeighbors, MLP, DecisionTree, RandomForest, and LinearRegression) The selection of the best model was done based on the high degree of accuracy of the model compared to other models. The best model is the DecisionTree model and that's because it has a test accuracy equal to 93.69%.
 
Finally, we did hyperparameter tuning to maximize the model performance by using the grid search method. Therefore, we choose to perform the tuning on CARTmodel which has an accuracy percentage of 93.69%. 




![linear](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28055394/188959264-6fa13eb2-0876-4d9e-a343-ccd7abefcbd8.png)






After tuning, MSE, MAE, and RMSE all improved, where the accuracy score increased to 96.31 %.
Classification Models:
With the same approach for the Classification models, we chose some models such as (KNeighbors, LogisticRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest, and GaussianNB) 


 
<img width="784" alt="classifiation" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28055394/188959179-599e292c-e749-4ce6-ba6f-09e4d89ac5c5.png">



After comparing the accuracy of the applied model. It's obviously clear to us that The best classification model accuracy is for the DecisionTree because it has an accuracy score equal to 95.61%. After that, we did a pipeline for the best model. 
Finally, as shown in the above chart, the performance of all models is high, so we decided that the model does not need any further tuning.


# Findings    

 ![result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28055394/188958866-928d064d-9f83-45b7-92ac-ffed43a2895d.png)
 

After applying machine learning  into the dataset we found out that:
•	A77.33% of classes have an average number of student less than or equal to the targeted number (22).
•	A 22.7% of classes have an average number of student per class more than or equal to the targeted number (22).
Action Plan
In order to achieve the targeted number of student per class in almost all schools by the end of  the year 2025, we have to reduce the number of schools that do not meet the targeted number gradually. Therefore, we must apply the followings:
•	By the end of 2023 we have to reduce the number of school with average number of students above 22 from 22.7% to 15% 
•	By the end of 2024 we have to reduce the number of school with average above 22 from 15% to 7.5 %
•	By the end of 2025 we have to reduce the number of school with average above 22 from 7.5 % to 0% 
•	This process must be done gradually as it  requires  adding more classes or even building new schools depending on the number of student and hiring the required number of teachers.
Conclusion
Using Machine Learning on the education system dataset will help to predict the average number of students per class in Saudi Arabia. It will also help in predicting the average class size, by type of institution and level of education. And the ratio of students to teaching staff.
